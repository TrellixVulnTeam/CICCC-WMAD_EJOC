# What I did understand about node js
Node.js is an environment (platform) for developing server applications in the JavaScript language.
It is a platform that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.
## Advantages
- Server-side and client-side can be developed in a single language (JavaScript).
- Uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine, which can handle large amounts of access at high speed.
- Scalable network applications can be easily built.
- The non-blocking I/O processing method makes it suitable for real-time applications that are lightweight and span distributed devices.
### Non-blocking I/O processing method
A method that executes input/output processing in an **asynchronous** manner.
For example, when a query is issued to a database, it moves to the next processing without waiting for the result to be returned.
And the result is received by an event.
**I/O** is an abbreviation for `input/output` (input/output).

## What are my expectations for the course.
- Learning about node_modules and package.json.
- Using express.js and React
- Also use yarn and YAML
