1) What is ES6?
-> ES6 is the second major revision to JavaScript.

2) Name 3 examples of ES6 feature.
-> The let keyword
	 The const keyword
	 JavaScript Arrow Functions

3) What is the difference between let and const?
-> The value of let can be changed.
	 The value of const cannot be changed.

4)  How do you access object values? Give 3 examples
-> Dot property accessor: object.property
	 Square brackets property accessor: object['property']
	 Object destructuring: const { property } = object

5) What does setInterval and setTimeout do?
-> setInterval executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds. Also it repeats the execution of the function continuously.
	 setTimeout executes a function only once, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

6) What are promises?
-> The promise object represents the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.




7) Convert this async function to async/await
getQuote().then((quote) => {
	console.log(quote)
}).catch(function(error) {
	console.log(error);
});
The answer is bellow
async function getQuote() {
	console.log(quote);
	const error = await function() {
		console.log(error);
	}
}
getQuote();




8) Convert this code to arrow function.
function greeting(firstname, lastname) {
	return `Hi, ${firstname} ${lastname}`
}
// The answer is bellow.
greeting = (firstname, lastname) => {
	return `Hi, ${firstname} ${lastname}`
}



9) Explain what a callback function is.
-> A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

10) What does the functions pop and push do to an array?
-> The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
	 The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.




11) What is the expected answer to this code?
var string1 = "";
var object1 = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
for (var property1 in object1) {
	string1 += object1[property1];
}
console.log(string1);
// The answer is bellow
"1 2 3"



12) What data type would Array.map() and Array.filter() return?
-> Array

13) What data type would Array.includes() and Array.some() return?
-> Boolean

14) Write down the 4 main methods of rest api
-> 1. GET
	 2. POST
	 3. PUT
	 4. DELETE

15) What is the difference between JSON and JavaScript object?
-> JSON is a "data format" based on the notation of JavaScript objects. Enclose keys and strings in double quotation marks. Don't need to enclose it if it is a number.

16) Explain what API is
-> API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

17) What is an api key?
-> An API key or application programming interface key is a code that gets passed in by computer applications. It is normally used to assist in tracking and controlling how the interface is being utilized. Often, it does this to prevent abuse or malicious use of the API in question.

18) Let's say we have query params that we want to include in an api call. example {a: 1, b: 2} How do we convert this into query-string?
-> {"a": 1, "b": 2}

19) What do we send in the body(data) of rest api?
-> Use POST or PUT method.
