		<h3>History</h3>
		<p>Vancouver means different things to different people.</p>
		<p>To some, it is a beautiful coastal city. To others, it is home.</p>
		<p>One way to better understand our identity is to look at our brand. A city’s brand is the asset that makes up its reputation and image. The City of Vancouver and the Vancouver Economic Commission retained Brand Finance (Canada) Inc. to find out Vancouver’s brand value.</p>

		<h3>Geography</h3>
		<p>The City of Vancouver is a coastal, seaport city on the mainland of British Columbia. Located on the western half of the Burrard Peninsula, Vancouver is bounded to the north by English Bay and the Burrard Inlet and to the south by the Fraser River.
		</p>
		<p>The City of Burnaby lies to the east and the Strait of Georgia to the west. Vancouver Island, across the Strait of Georgia, shields Vancouver from the Pacific Ocean.
		</p>

		<h3>Weather in Vancouver</h3>
		<p>Vancouver has a moderate, oceanic climate. Protected by the mountains and warmed by the Pacific ocean currents, Vancouver is one of the warmest cities in Canada.
		</p>
		<p>Although Vancouver has a reputation for rain, it actually ranks as the 9th rainiest location in Canada with Prince Rupert, Port Alberni, Chilliwack, Abbotsford, Campbell River, Halifax, Sydney, and St. John's beating Vancouver for average yearly rainfall. Vancouver's wettest months are November and December with an average precipitation of 182mm. And - with an average of just 41mm of precipitation - July and August are the driest months in Vancouver.</p>
