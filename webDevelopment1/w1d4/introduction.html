      <p>
        The oldest part of the city, Gastown is an area of restaurants,
        galleries, and shops set in carefully restored Victorian buildings.
        Heritage structures, cobblestone streets, and iron lampposts give the
        district its distinctive atmosphere. Gastown is a short walk from Canada
        Place.

      <p>
        Vancouver's first tourist attraction opened in 1889 and has been
        thrilling visitors with its swaying bridge over a plummeting canyon ever
        since. The footbridge spans a 70-meter deep river canyon leading to an
        activity park filled with forest trails and a treetop walk through
        old-growth giants. There's also a collection of totem poles and a
        transparent suspended platform known as the Cliffwalk.

      <p>
        Stanley Park is a lush peninsula of huge trees adjacent to Downtown
        Vancouver. If you are looking to get outside and enjoy some nature, this
        is the best place to visit in Vancouver. A paved seawall path encircles
        the green space and is a wonderful place to explore on foot or by
        bicycle.

      <p>
        Oceanfront English Bay centers on one of the city's loveliest and
        busiest beaches. Part of the West End neighborhood, English Bay offers
        shopping and high-end restaurants, but is also a popular outdoor area
        where people come to walk, bike, rollerblade, or hang out with the
        public art installations.
