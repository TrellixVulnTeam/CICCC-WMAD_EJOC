## Install Express
### Tip: --save
> Tip − The `--save` flag can be replaced by the `-S` flag. This flag ensures that Express is added as a dependency to our **package.json** file. This has an advantage, the next time we need to install all the dependencies of our project we can just run the command npm install and it will find the dependencies in this file and install them for us.


## HTTP Hosting
### The application starts the server and listens for connections on port 3000.
Respond to requests for the root URL (/) with "Hello World!”
 "404 Not Found" for all other paths.

### Web frameworks provide resources such as HTML pages, scripts, images, etc. at different routes.
The following function is used to define routes in an Express application.

method: METHOD can be applied to any one of the HTTP verbs — get, set, put, delete.
path: The route at which the request will run.
handler: A callback function that executes when a matching request type is found on the relevant route.
